"-x yes" with out qoutes for enabling alarm(required to do everytime u want to run the program with the alarm,defaults to no)-
"-a" because this program works by using the first frame as a template of sorts, u can adjust the minimum area size needed to updated for it to be considerd motion, it defaults to 500 but its recomended that u increase the number for avoiding false positive
